## About Me

My name is Marina and I am currently pursuing my MSc in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Ion Androutsopoulos](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/) and [Prof. John Pavlopoulos](https://ipavlopoulos.github.io/). My research centers on Multimodal Large Language Models and their applications in the biomedical field, particularly in Diagnostic Captioning. I am especially interested in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Generative AI.

Additionally, I am an active member of the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/) at AUEB, where we engage in research on NLP and Machine Learning.



## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Image Captioning, Object Detection, Video Captioning
- **Natural Language Processing:** Large Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, Text Generation, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- **Deep Learning**: Multimodal Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks


## News

- **[Oct. 2024]** My thesis in under the final review and will be available soon in the AUEB NLP Groupâ€™s [website](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/theses.html)
- **[Sept. 2024]** We presented our paper for ImageCLEFmedical 2024 at the [CLEF conference](https://clef2024.imag.fr/) in Grenoble, France.
- **[May 2024]** We submitted our paper for the [ImageCLEFmedical 2024](https://www.imageclef.org/2024/medical) campaign.
