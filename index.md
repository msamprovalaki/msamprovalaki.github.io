## About Me

AI Engineer at [Agile Actors](https://www.agileactors.com) and Researcher with the [AUEB Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/), specializing in the end-to-end development of Generative AI and Multimodal systems. Expert in architecting Agentic RAG pipelines for complex image and document retrieval, with a deep research background in Multimodal LLMs applied to the biomedical domain. Proven track record in developing high-accuracy Diagnostic Captioning systems. Passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge Deep Learning research and scalable, production-ready AI solutions.

## Research Interests

- **Agentic Reasoning**: Researching and implementing multi-agent systems using autonomous planning and self-correction loops.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Investigating decentralized coordination and conflict resolution within agent ecosystems.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Researching standardized infrastructure for universal interoperability between LLMs and enterprise data tools.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RLHF/DPO)**: Investigating Direct Preference Optimization and Reward Modeling for model-human alignment.
- **Agent-to-Agent Protocols**: Investigating standardized communication layers for cross-platform agent collaboration.
- **Foundation Vision Models**: Researching self-supervised pre-training for universal image and video representation.
